           <p>Now that you have an inventory building, you are going to need to set up a place to sell your items.
              Typically, many people would start off by setting up accounts across multiple online shops, such as eBay, 
              Poshmark, Esty, Instagram, and even their own stores. Along with setting up shops on these styles of websites, 
              people often will grab social media handles of their respective shops, to better connect with customers, and also 
              have a greater presence to help their sales.
