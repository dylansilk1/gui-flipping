           <h2>How to Ship:</h2>
           <p>Congratulations! Youâ€™ve made some sales and now need to worry about getting the items
              to the customer. If you sell on a website like eBay, you will be able to get a shipping
              label through them for hopefully relatively cheap, for a better price margin. 
              You will also need different shipping supplies, such as boxes, bubble wrap,
              foam padding, and possibly packing peanuts. You should package your item safely,
              to get good reviews, and a smaller chance of losing money from a damaged item.
