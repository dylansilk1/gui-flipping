           <h2>How to Acquire Inventory:</h2>
           <p>To start flipping, you are going to need to have items to flip. 
              I believe you should start with a niche that you’re interested in, as you’re going to
              need knowledge of items and their prices to be able to properly flip them. 
              When starting out I picked retro gaming / consoles, but you could go with things like
              clothes, tools, toys, etc. Now you may be wondering, where are you going to find 
              cheap items to flip? There are many places you can go, such as different thrift stores,
              garage sales, flea markets, or Facebook marketplace are always great starting points.
              These types of stores are known for cheap prices, and the ability to haggle with
              prices as well to work out a deal for you.
