           <h2>The Definition:</h2>
           <p>Flipping is when you buy an item, which you intend to sell to make a quick profit, rather than holding onto it for the value to appreciate.
              Typically, people attempt to buy items cheaper than what they are worth and take the item to the correct market where they can sell it for
              a profit.
