           <p>Lastly are just some general tips that I think have helped me with flipping items.
              An extremely useful tool that you can use is google sheets or excel. It will take some
              time to get yourself an operating sheet, but once you have it, it’s an incredibly
              useful tool to keep track of your expenses. You can track items that you find, 
              their prices, how much it costs to shop, gas prices, and many other things that may
              otherwise prove difficult to track. Another useful tool is some way of keeping data
              on when and where you’re finding items, as finding inventory can be hard. This tool
              will help you narrow down when you should be hitting certain areas, such as thrift
              stores. All in all, that’s a very rough guide on how you can get started with 
              flipping, and hopefully make it into a profitable little business.

            <h3>A simple example of a Google/Excel sheet:</h3>
            <p> <!-- Here I use a table to make an example of a tool to help with flipping -->
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Item</th>
                        <th>Price purchased at</th>
                        <th>Price sold at</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Marvel vs Capcom 2</td>
                        <td>$3.59</td>
                        <td>$170</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</td>
                        <td>$3.59</td>
                        <td>$40</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
